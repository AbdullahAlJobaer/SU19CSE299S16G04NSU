## 1. Introduction:

There are many events happenings in NORTH SOUTH UNIVERSITY (NSU). There is no specific dedicated platform to share their details (Yes we have Facebook but it’s not a dedicated platform). There are 23 clubs in NSU and many students chapter as well, also we have Career Placement Centre (CPC) and Office of External Affairs (OEA) and all of them has several events, workshops, seminar, competition and many more. Our prime focus of the website is to make a platform where the users can create an event, update it, delete it and also we will integrate Facebook sharing options here also thus user can share their event from the website also. For Facebook sharing ,we will create a FACEBOOK page for our website and when any event is created ,the page will post about the event details here and we will make a process thus we can share this events in NSU related groups automatically.


## 2. Software Specification

We will have different interface like for Hosts and Users. Every host is a user but not all the users are host. The host has the right to launch an event in the website and also has the ability to update and delete it. But also he has to pay a minimal fee to continue his host status. The user can only see whatever event is going around him and he doesn’t have any rights to host any events.


### 2.1 Landing Page

### 2.9 Account


We couldn’t  create this section of the website. Hopefully we will think about it as soon as we figure it out.




## 3)Technology:

### 3.1 Proposed Technology Stack

We selected Github as project management tool, Trello for different task allocation. For backend site of this site we selected Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework, PostgreSQL for database management and Frontend part we selected HTML5, CSS3, BOOT STRAP 4 and other necessary tools and language. We selected Sublime as a text editor also.

### 3.2 Implemented Technology Stack

We used Github as our project management tool but use did not use Trello. Instead of Trello we use kanban board of Github as our task allocator. For Frontend part, we use just HTML5 and CSS3. We did not use BOOT STRAP 4. And we use Atom as a text editor because we find it much easier than Sublime. On the other hand for Backend, we have used Ruby as backend language and Ruby on Rails as framework. The data will save automatically via gems calling name Devise.


## 4)Business Plan:

This website is now only based on North South University. There will be students, faculties and other stuffs. So we have to think sensibly about the payment method. Now a day mobile banking is becoming popular day by day. That is why we want to apply some mobile banking options like Bkash, Rocket etc. in our website. The payment will be minimal as like 10 or 15 taka per month for the hosts. Every host has to renew their id every month. But for the regular students and other viewers it will be free totally.

## 5. Conclusion

This platform can save our valuable times as the event hosts have to continuously post about their events continuously on different groups and also it makes spamming reports from the Facebook users as same posts are posting on the groups continuously and we miss many important posts in the Facebook groups as a normal Facebook user.

By this dedicated platform any user who wants to seek what is happening in NSU can get the details and also can attend it very easily.

One platform, all events.
